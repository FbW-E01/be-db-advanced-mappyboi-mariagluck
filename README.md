# Mappy boi project

This project is a pre-alpha prototype of an app with which regular citizens could report abandoned bicycles (and maybe more?) to their municipality. It is far from complete!

> Before starting with the task, have a look around the code!
> **NOTE:** There is 217 lines of relevant code/markup in all these files - it's less than you would think and it's not a bad idea to spend time going through all the files here!

## BACKEND

- `$ npm i`
- `$ npm run dev`

## FRONTED

- `$ npm i`
- `$ npm start`

# TASK

- Add your answers here and code your solutions normally.

3. Make use of Schemas and Models in the backend!

5. What is a captcha?

      A CAPTCHA is a program that protects websites against bots by generating and grading tests that humans can pass but current computer programs cannot. For example, humans can read distorted text but current computer programs can't.
      The term CAPTCHA (for Completely Automated Public Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart) was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper and John Langford of Carnegie Mellon University.

6. Spend a maximum of 10 minutes on this question: how would you design a captcha for this form?
I would look for options to install pre-programmed captchas and install it.
for example: import ReCaptchaV2 from 'react-google-recaptcha'

7. **BONUS** Get all notifications from the backend and somehow show them in the fronted
8. **SUPER BONUS** Implement a captcha for this form without using any extra npm dependencies
9. **XTRA BONUS** Make the frontend look 𝓖𝓸𝓸𝓭
